                <br>
                <p>We’re Christopher and Shawn, the founders of DRIVER.<br>
                   What makes us good friends and business partners is<br>
                   our passion for people, creative solutions, sustainability,<br>
                      and electric vehicles. One weekend, during a backpacking <br>
                      trip in the San Bernardino National Forest, we discovered<br>
                       we could make a positive impact on our planet even after<br>
                        we left the forest. Thus, DRIVER was born. Through self-<br>
                        sustainable vehicles, we could prevent carbon emissions<br>
                         from harming the environment. With one rental company,<br> 
                         our goal is to inspire the community and the world to opt<br>
                          out of renting gas-powered vehicles and rent sustainable<br>
                            all-electric cars instead.</p>

            <br>
             <p>We aim to provide safe, convenient, fun, alternative transportation for short and intermediate<br>
             travel. We’re the sustainable companion to your girls’ trip, guys' trip, or business trip. With a<br>
             convenient, virtual, frictionless rental process, fast delivery, and safe transportation, you never<br>

             we love them. By softening our environmental impact, we’re inspiring our community to replace <br>
             gas-powered vehicle rentals with all-electric vehicle rentals. Zero guilt. All fun.<br>
